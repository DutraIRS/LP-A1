Zap the son of a bitch again  Live your life like it's a coma Won't you tell me why we'd want to With all the reasons you give It's kinda hard to believe  But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason Why you should stay Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride Got a one way ticket to your suicide Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old But if home is where the heart is  Then there's stories to be told No, you don't need a doctor No one else can heal your soul  Got your mind in submission Got your life on the line But nobody pulled the trigger They just stepped aside They'll be down by the water While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  They'll be callin' in the morning They'll be hanging on the phone They'll be waitin' for an answer But you know nobody's home And when the bells stop ringing It was nobody's fault but your own  There were always ample warning There were always subtle signs And you would have seen them coming  But we gave you too much time And when you said that no one's listening Why'd your best friend drop a dime Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  Way to spend our time  And it's so easy to be social It's so easy to be cool Yeah, its easy to get hungry When you ain't got shit to lose And I wish that I could help you With what you hope to find But I'm still out here waiting Watching reruns of my life When you reach the point of breaking Know it's gonna take some time To heal those broken memories That another man would need Just to survive"

Let's get something straight, alright? Promised never to leave me! This whole thing was fucked up Never to leave me alone! All men betray. All lose heart! I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe Black men and white men Together at the table of brotherhood! I have a dream Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!  I won't be told anymore That I've been brought down in this storm And left so far out from the shore And I can't find my way back, my way anymore  No I won't be told anymore That I've been brought back in this storm And left so far out from the shore That I can't find my way back, my way anymore"
Chinese Democracy,This I Love,2008,W. Axl Rose,7156500,And now I don't know why She wouldn't say goodbye But then it seems that I Had seen it in her eyes  And it might not be wise I'd still have to try With all the love I have inside I can't deny  I just can't let it die 'Cause her heart's just like mine She holds her pain inside  So if you ask me why She wouldn't say goodbye I know somewhere inside  There is a special light Still shining bright And even on the darkest night She can't deny  So if she's somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me There's no one else Could ever make me feel I'm so alive I hoped she'd never leave me Please God you must believe me I've searched the universe And found myself Within' her eyes  No matter how I try They say it's all a lie So what's the use of my Confessions to a crime Of passions that won't die In my heart  So if she's somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me There's no one else Could ever make me feel I'm so alive I hoped she'd never leave me Please God you must believe me I've searched the universe And found myself Within' her eyes  So if she's somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me There's no one else Could ever make me feel I'm so alive  I hoped she'd never leave me Please God you must believe me I've searched the universe And found myself Within' her eyes  And now I don't know why She wouldn't say goodbye It just might be that I Had seen it in her eyes And now it seems that I Gave up my ghost of pride I'll never say goodbye
Chinese Democracy,Prostitute,2008,"Robert John Finck, William Axl Rose, Paul H. Tobias",616316,"Seems like forever and a day  If my intentions are misunderstood Please be kind I've done all I should I won't ask of you What I would not do Oh, I saw the damage in you My fortunate one The envy of youth  Why would they Tell me to please those That laugh in my face With all of the reasons They've taught Fall over themselves To give way, oh yeah  It's not a question Whether my heart is true Streamlined I had to pull through Look for a new Beginning on you Oh, I, I got a message for you Up and away It's what I gotta do Give what you have For what you might lose  What would you say If I told you that I'm to blame? And what would you do If I had to deny your name? Where would you go if I told you ""I love you"" And then walk away? Oh yeah! N' who should I turn to If not for the ones That you would not save? Alright  I told you when I found you If there were doubts you Should be careful and unafraid Now They surround you And all that amounts too Is love that you fed by Perversion and pain  So if my affections Are misunderstood And you decide I'm up To no good Don't ask me to Enjoy them Just for you  Ask yourself What I would choose To prostitute myself To live with fortune and shame Oh yeah! When you should Have turned to the hearts Of the ones That you could not save, oh now!  I told you when I found you All that amounts too Is love that you fed by Perversion and pain"
